## Why Anime Inspires Me
Anime is more than just entertainment — it’s a philosophy of creativity, resilience, and imagination. Watching characters push beyond their limits inspires me to push beyond mine as a developer and creator.

## Favorite Series
- **Naruto / Naruto Shippuden**
  - Taught me about perseverance ("Dattebayo!") and teamwork.
- **Attack on Titan**
  - Strategic thinking and the weight of decisions resonate with how I architect systems.
- **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood**
  - The balance of rules ("Equivalent Exchange") and creativity inspires my coding craft.
- **Steins;Gate**
  - The power of experimentation and iteration reminds me of debugging and testing.
- **My Hero Academia**
  - Everyone has a quirk (strength), and it’s all about mastering it.
- **Jujutsu Kaisen**
  - High-pressure situations, split-second decisions, and embracing your inner demons — perfect parallels to coding under pressure.
- **Dragon Ball (Z / Super)**
  - The relentless drive to keep leveling up, never being satisfied with the current state — the ultimate growth mindset.
- **Ao Ashi**
  - A reminder that even in a team sport (or dev team), your individual growth and awareness elevate everyone else.

## How Anime Influences My Work
- **Aesthetics**: Clean, intentional, and bold UI designs influenced by anime visuals.
- **Storytelling**: Crafting user experiences that feel like a journey, with emotional beats.
- **Resilience**: Embracing failure as part of growth, just like any shonen protagonist.
