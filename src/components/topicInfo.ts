  Anime: `
Anime is more than just entertainment — it’s a philosophy of creativity, resilience, and imagination. Watching characters push beyond their limits inspires me to push beyond mine as a developer and creator.

Favorite Series
- Naruto / Naruto Shippuden
  - Taught me about perseverance ("Dattebayo!") and teamwork.
- Attack on Titan
  - Strategic thinking and the weight of decisions resonate with how I architect systems.
- Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
  - The balance of rules ("Equivalent Exchange") and creativity inspires my coding craft.
- Steins Gate
  - The power of experimentation and iteration reminds me of debugging and testing.
- My Hero Academia
  - Everyone has a quirk (strength), and it’s all about mastering it.
- Jujutsu Kaisen
  - High-pressure situations, split-second decisions, and embracing your inner demons — perfect parallels to coding under pressure.
- Dragon Ball (Z / Super)
  - The relentless drive to keep leveling up, never being satisfied with the current state — the ultimate growth mindset.
- Ao Ashi
  - A reminder that even in a team sport (or dev team), your individual growth and awareness elevate everyone else.

How Anime Influences My Work
- Aesthetics: Clean, intentional, and bold UI designs influenced by anime visuals.
- Storytelling: Crafting user experiences that feel like a journey, with emotional beats.
- Resilience: Embracing failure as part of growth, just like any shonen protagonist.
