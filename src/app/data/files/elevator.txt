Hi, I’m Edwin — a creative technologist, software engineer, and anime enthusiast who brings a unique blend of technical precision and poetic vision to everything I build.  

I specialize in crafting seamless, scalable web applications and integrating innovative technologies like AI and chatbots to elevate user experiences.  

With a foundation in resilience and constant learning, I turn challenges into opportunities — whether in code, in design, or in life. Let’s create something extraordinary together.
